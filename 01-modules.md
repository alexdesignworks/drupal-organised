# Modules

* Custom modules are used on the platform to deliver custom functionality.
* All custom specific modules MUST be prefixed with `projectshortname_`.
* Modules MAY be completely custom or feature­-based.
* For search and navigation simplicity, both custom and feature-based modules SHOULD be stored in `sites/all/modules/custom`.
* Feature­-based modules MAY contain custom code.
