# Drupal Organised
## A community-managed guide on best approaches to organise [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) projects

#Why
We need better organised Drupal websites, because we should not spend days trying to understand what previous developer built and where it is all placed.

# Contributing
* To discuss anything simply open an issue.
* For changes, create a Pull Request.
* Spread the word. We want more people to be involved in building good websites.
