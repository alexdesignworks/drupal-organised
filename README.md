# Drupal Organised
## Community-managed guide on best approaches to organise [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) projects
**All donations are forwarded to Drupal Association.**

## Why
1. As developers, we need better organised Drupal websites, because we should not spend days trying to understand what previous developer built and where it is all located.
2. As community memebers, we want to rely on community experience to make this a truly community-driven guide.
3. As project participants, we need a centralised reference for such documentation.
