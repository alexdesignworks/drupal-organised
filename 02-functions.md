# Functions

* Functions **MUST** be prefixed with full module name.
* Use leading underscore for 'private' functions. Such functions should never be called from outside of modules they declared in.
* Private functions **SHOULD** be placed at the bottom of the file.
* Functions can have 2 types of comments: 1 liner comment (literally, 1 line only) OR full description with parameters descriptions. Both 1-line and full description comments must comply to the coding standards.
