# JavaScript

* Files MUST be stored in module's `js` directory.
* JS files MUST be named as a module name with underscored replaced by dashes. E.g, `my_module` => `myÂ­-module.js`.
* More specific JS files SHOULD be included separately and named with `.my-feature` suffix. I.e. `my-module.my-feature.js`.
* Use the following template as a scaffolding code:

```javascript
/**
 * @file
 *
 */

/*global jQuery, Drupal*/

(function ($) {
  "use strict";
  Drupal.behaviors.my_module = {
    attach: function (context) {

    }
  };
}(jQuery));
```
