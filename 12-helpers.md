# Helpers

It is advised to use a wonderful [drupal\_helpers](https://github.com/nicksantamaria/drupal_helpers) module authored by [Nick Santamaria](https://github.com/nicksantamaria) , [Alex Skrypnyk](https://github.com/drevops) and other contributors. Please try to utilise this module as much as possible instead of using own custom solutions.

`drupal_helpers` has tests that makes it very stable.
